# Reflection
Personality Reflection
To reflect on my results from taking the Big 5 personality test, and personally analysing myself against Tomlinson’s (2017) article on the forms of graduate capital and their relationship to graduate employability, it's good to first look at how I performed. You can find my results linked to this page, but I'll summarise them as well.

I scored exceptionally high in agreeableness and openness to experience, indicating a genuine curiosity, willingness to collaborate, and receptivity to new ideas. My extraversion rating confirms that I thrive in interactive settings, drawing energy from teamwork and stakeholder engagement. The surprisingly low neuroticism score underscores my ability to remain composed under pressure, a trait I’ve consistently received feedback on throughout my academic and professional journey. These Big Five results have validated my self‐perception as a calm, adaptable collaborator, while also prompting me to question whether moments of self‐critique or internal tension might be underrepresented.

Whilst I've already completed a self-reflection on the different forms of graduate capital, I'm now able to compare my quantitative scores against some criteria.

A score of 43/50 in Human Capital is a high score, encompassing the knowledge and skills that I have  developed. I possess strong skills, knowledge, and relevant experience to my chosen field of mechanical engineering, positioning me strongly in human capital. As seen on my portfolio I have demonstrated my ability to translate theoretical concepts, such as maxwells equations into operational prototypes for Brushless DC motor design and aerospace engineering challenges. I recognise the need now to broaden my horizons and continue to build my expertise by getting my hands dirty with specialised projects and advanced training.

Social Capital was my worst performing, with a score of 39/50. This didn’t surprise me. Scoring myself highly in confidence in teamwork and positive attitude it also revealed where I am currently struggling the most, my professional network. Whilst I believe I excel at immediate team dynamics, being in the early stage of my career journey and my own fault, I have had limited interactions with Industry professionals and hence negatively impacted my own ability to secure industry experience. To remedy this, I will dedicate weekly time in my calendar, specifically for reaching out to industry professionals on LinkedIn and attending targeted networking events over the coming year. Tracking the outcomes of these connections, will help me quantify my own progress in this critical graduate capital dimension.

Scoring extremely high in psychological capital, at 46/50, again placed me in the highest band. From this we can diagnose I have a high sense of confidence, optimism and resilience, being well prepared to handle career challenges and changes. This I agree with, having worked across 10+ diverse industries in a wide variety of seniority and time, I feel that no matter the situation I am put in, I'm capable of figuring it out and fitting in. In order to continue developing my psychological capital I am continuing to seek out challenging projects and leadership opportunities, both things I am currently doing with my foray into ASV's with my Final Year Project, Becoming Project Lead for the propulsion test bed fixed wing plane for MUAS as well as applying to relevant leadership positions with MUAS.

My identity capital scored 46/50, again extremely high. I do believe I have a clear vision of my personal brand and of my hopeful career trajectory. I believe when faced with challenging interview questions about myself, that I'm confident in answering and articulating who I am, especially past who I am in my academic and professional capacity to who I am personally, something that is also valuable in a professional environment. I plan to further enhance my Identity capital to the outside viewer by improving my socials like LinkedIn and this website, and adding more projects, whilst also pursuing leadership roles.
 
Lastly for Tomlinson’s (2017) article on the forms of graduate capital and their relationship to graduate employability was Cultural Capital. I scored highly in this as well, and it confirms my own sensitivity to professional norms and etiquette across disciplines. This is something I believe that I have taken great strides to develop in myself, with living overseas twice for extended periods of time, and interacting with so many different cultures as well as working in a super wide variety of professional roles. My next steps will be to expand my cultural knowledge by attending industry conferences and engaging with companies.


The impact this analysis has had on my self-understanding has been transformative. Its not only highlighted my self-awareness but also my awareness of the people around me and their potential individual strengths and challenges. Understanding not everyone has low neuroticism like me, I am prepared to recognise early signs of stress and prepared to redistribute workloads or offer support. Recognizing varied capital across different individuals has made me attuned to the nuances of collaboration and the need for being mindful of difference workplace expectations, I can now see myself approaching team dynamics with greater empathy and flexibility, something that is crucial in multidisciplinary environments.

In terms of career trajectory, this reflection has reinforced my commitment to a path within mechanical or aerospace engineering. My work with UAV's, ASV's and motor design isnt just limited to pursuing engineering excellence, its about solving hard challenges and creating a positive impact. By developing each form of graduate capital, I believe I'm equipping myself to lead projects that solve the bigger problems.

Ultimately this exercise has shifted my mindset, employability isnt a static checklist, but something to embrace as a dynamic and multifaceted journey, a reminder that growth isn't just about my hard skills, but my mindset, relationships and personal identity that will allow those skills to thrive.
