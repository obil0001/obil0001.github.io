# Swot Analysis
S: In the areas relevant to my goal, I believe I have extensively developed certain soft and hard skills much more than some of my peers. Especially related to soft skills I have extensive experience in project management and large team coordination as the acting Chief Operating Officer of Monash Uncrewed Aerial Systems. This has given me extensive insight into managing and keeping on track massive teams with large amounts of finances, stakeholder involvement and other. I also believe i am personable and easy to get along with, something that makes me very easy to work with and for others to express things to me without judgement. I am uniquely positioned in front of lots of other mechanical engineering students in that i am completing a double degree with business analytics. My personal contacts include members of Monash Pearl, Family and Friends in Engineering and many other Sponsors I had the opportunity to interact with.




W:In some areas relevant to my career goal, I believe my peers are better than me in some elements such as hard skills relating to machining - something i would like to have more experience with. Also I do not have as good grades as some of my peers which may be an influencing factor in my career. Lastly, I know other people have more established connections and are better at networking than I am, something I will endeavour to work upon. 




O:One massive opportunity I have found for myself recently is the new position as COO at MUAS. This has uniquely positioned me as head of a very large organisation which I can use to develop my soft and hard skills, but perhaps most importantly, gives me an incredible opportunity to network with industry and gain valuable connections in the field that i want to be a part of




T: The threats that are facing me in my industry are majorly the competition. Engineering is saturated and despite there being a lot of need for jobs, they are incredibly competitive and the fight for things like internships and grad roles is insane.
